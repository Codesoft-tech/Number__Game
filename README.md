# Number__Game
A simple Java-based number guessing game where the player has a fixed number of chances to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, hints are given whether the number is too high or too low. The playerâ€™s score increases for each correct guess, and they can choose to play multiple rounds.
